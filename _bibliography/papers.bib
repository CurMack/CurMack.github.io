  abstract={Estimating full-body human motion via sparse tracking
    signals from head-mounted displays and hand controllers in
    3D scenes is crucial to applications in AR/VR. One of the
    biggest challenges to this task is the one-to-many mapping
    from sparse observations to dense full-body motions, which
    endowed inherent ambiguities. To help resolve this ambiguous problem, we introduce a new framework to combine rich
    contextual information provided by scenes to benefit fullbody motion tracking from sparse observations. To estimate
    plausible human motions given sparse tracking signals and
    3D scenes, we develop S2Fusion, a unified framework fusing Scene and sparse Signals with a conditional difFusion
    model. S2Fusion first extracts the spatial-temporal relations
    residing in the sparse signals via a periodic autoencoder,
    and then produces time-alignment feature embedding as
    additional inputs. Subsequently, by drawing initial noisy
    motion from a pre-trained prior, S2Fusion utilizes conditional diffusion to fuse scene geometry and sparse tracking signals to generate full-body scene-aware motions. The
    sampling procedure of S2Fusion is further guided by a specially designed scene-penetration loss and phase-matching
    loss, which effectively regularizes the motion of the lower body even in the absence of any tracking signals, making the generated motion much more plausible and coherent. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that
    our S2Fusion outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of
    estimation quality and smoothness.},

    Human-object interaction (HOI) synthesis is crucial for applications in animation,
    simulation, and robotics. However, existing approaches either rely on expensive
    motion capture data or require manual reward engineering, limiting their scalability
    and generalizability. In this work, we introduce the first unified physics-based
    HOI framework that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable longhorizon interactions with diverse object types—including static, dynamic, and
    articulated objects. We introduce VLM-Guided Relative Movement Dynamics
    (RMD), a fine-grained spatio-temporal bipartite representation that automatically
    constructs goal states and reward functions for reinforcement learning. By encoding structured relationships between human and object parts, RMD enables VLMs
    to generate semantically grounded, interaction-aware motion guidance without
    manual reward tuning. To support our methodology, we present Interplay, a novel
    dataset with thousands of long-horizon static and dynamic interaction plans. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods
    in synthesizing natural, human-like motions across both simple single-task and
    complex multi-task scenarios.

  abstract={
    Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness, physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities, including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners’ movements while avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction, showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

  abstract={
    Human action-reaction synthesis, a fundamental challenge in modeling causal
    human interactions, plays a critical role in applications ranging from virtual reality
    to social robotics. While diffusion-based models have demonstrated promising
    performance, they exhibit two key limitations for interaction synthesis: reliance
    on complex noise-to-reaction generators with intricate conditional mechanisms,
    and frequent physical violations in generated motions. To address these issues,
    we propose Action-Reaction Flow Matching (ARFlow), a novel framework that
    establishes direct action-to-reaction mappings, eliminating the need for complex
    conditional mechanisms. Our approach introduces a physical guidance mechanism specifically designed for Flow Matching (FM) that effectively prevents body
    penetration artifacts during sampling. Moreover, we discover the bias of traditional flow matching sampling algorithm and employ a reprojection method to
    revise the sampling direction of FM. To further enhance the reaction diversity,
    we incorporate randomness into the sampling process. Extensive experiments
    on NTU120, Chi3D and InterHuman datasets demonstrate that ARFlow not only
    outperforms existing methods in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance and motion
    diversity but also significantly reduces body collisions, as measured by our new
    Intersection Volume and Intersection Frequency metrics.

  abstract={
  3d object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d object, which is crucial for human-object interaction (HOI), embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem via learning through demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge due to we find such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG: a diffusion-based 3d affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization.

  abstract={
    Humanoid locomotion faces a critical scalability challenge: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods require task-specific rewards and struggle to leverage growing datasets, even as more training terrains are introduced. We propose DreamPolicy, a unified framework that enables a single policy to master diverse terrains and generalize zero-shot to unseen scenarios by systematically integrating offline data and diffusion-driven motion synthesis. At its core, DreamPolicy introduces Humanoid Motion Imagery (HMI) - future state predictions synthesized through an autoregressive terrain-aware diffusion planner curated by aggregating rollouts from specialized policies across various distinct terrains. Unlike human motion datasets requiring laborious retargeting, our data directly captures humanoid kinematics, enabling the diffusion planner to synthesize "dreamed" trajectories that encode terrain-specific physical constraints. These trajectories act as dynamic objectives for our HMI-conditioned policy, bypassing manual reward engineering and enabling cross-terrain generalization. Crucially, DreamPolicy addresses the scalability limitations of prior methods: while traditional RL fails to exploit growing datasets, our framework scales seamlessly with more offline data. As the dataset expands, the diffusion prior learns richer locomotion skills, which the policy leverages to master new terrains without retraining. Experiments demonstrate that DreamPolicy achieves an average of 90% success rates in training environments and an average of 20% higher success on unseen terrains than the prevalent method. It also generalizes to perturbed and composite scenarios where prior approaches collapse. By unifying offline data, diffusion-based trajectory synthesis, and policy optimization, DreamPolicy overcomes the "one task, one policy" bottleneck, establishing a paradigm for scalable, data-driven humanoid control.
